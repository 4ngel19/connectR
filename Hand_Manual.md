# ConnectR: User Manual

ConnectR is an R function designed to calculate biogeographic connectivity indices with bootstrap sampling. It processes data from Excel or CSV files and generates visualizations of the index distributions.

## **Function Overview**

### **Function Signature**
```r
ConnectR(file, type, sheets = "", indices = "", n_boot = 1000, dist_type = "density")
```

## **Arguments**

| Argument    | Type                 | Default        | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `file`      | `character`          | **Required**   | File path to the Excel (`.xlsx`) or CSV (`.csv`) data file.                                 |
| `type`      | `character`          | **Required**   | File type: `"excel"` or `"csv"`.                                                           |
| `sheets`    | `character` or `NULL`| `""`           | Names or indices of sheets to process. If `""`, all sheets will be processed.              |
| `indices`   | `character`          | `""`           | Indices to calculate: `BC`, `AO`, `AE`, `NC`. If `""`, all indices will be calculated.     |
| `n_boot`    | `integer`            | `1000`         | Number of bootstrap samples for resampling.                                                |
| `dist_type` | `character`          | `"density"`    | Distribution type for visualization: `"density"` or `"histogram"`.                         |

## **Input Data Format**

The input file must be either an Excel file (`.xlsx`) or a CSV file (`.csv`) and should adhere to the following structure:  
- **Rows**: Represent taxon/species.  
- **Columns**: Represent localities.  
- **Cell values**: Use `0` for absence and `1` for taxon presence in localities.  

### Example:
|         | Locality1 | Locality2 | Locality3 |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Taxon 1 | 1         | 0         | 1         |
| Taxon 2 | 0         | 1         | 1         |

## **Output**

The output is a combined data frame containing the calculated indices for all sheets processed. It includes:  
- Calculated indices (`BC`, `AO`, `AE`, `NC`).  
- Sheet names (if applicable).  

---

## **Examples**

### Example 1: Process all sheets in an Excel file
```R
result <- ConnectR(file = "data.xlsx", type = "excel")
```
###Example 2: Process selected sheets and specific indices
```R
result <- ConnectR(file = "data.xlsx", type = "excel", sheets = c(1, 2), indices = c("BC", "AO"))
```
###Example 3: Example 3: Use CSV file and customize bootstrap settings
```R
result <- ConnectR(file = "data.csv", type = "csv", n_boot = 500, dist_type = "histogram")
```R
Â¡Important! if no index is decared and the argumen is not included such as in Example 1. All indixes will be calculated. 
```

## **Visualization Customization**

You can customize the visual representation of the bootstrapped indices by specifying the type of distribution plot you want to generate.  

### **Available Options**
- **Density Plot (`"density"`)**: Displays a smooth curve representing the density of bootstrapped values.  
- **Histogram (`"histogram"`)**: Displays a bar chart showing the frequency distribution of bootstrapped values.

### **Example Usage**
Specify the `dist_type` argument to choose your desired visualization type:
```R
result <- ConnectR(file = "data.xlsx", type = "excel", dist_type = "histogram")
```
### **Customization Notes**

Visualizations are automatically scaled to fit all selected indices.

- Each index will have its own distribution plot, and they are arranged dynamically based on the number of indices selected.
  
- For easier interpretation, plots include axis labels, legends, and titles.

## **Warnings**

When running the analysis, there are several cases that may trigger warnings. These are important to address to ensure accurate results.

### **Empty Sheets**
If a sheet has no presence (`O = 0`) or no taxa (`N = 0`), it will be skipped in the analysis. A warning message will notify you about the skipped sheets.  


### **Input Validation**
Ensure your input file follows the correct format:
- Excel files should have rows representing taxa/species and columns representing localities, with `1` indicating presence and `0` indicating absence.
- CSV files should follow the same structure.

If the input file does not match the expected format, an error or warning may occur.

### **Bootstrap Settings**
- High values of `n_boot` can result in long processing times. If you're running on large datasets, consider using a smaller value for `n_boot` to reduce computational time.
- If you experience long run times, try reducing the number of bootstrap iterations or optimize your input data.

---

By paying attention to these warnings, you can ensure that the analysis runs smoothly and that the results are reliable.

## **Dependencies**

To run the `ConnectR` function, the following R packages are required:

- **readxl**: For reading Excel files.  
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation and processing.  
- **ggplot2**: For creating visualizations.  
- **gridExtra**: For arranging multiple plots in a grid.  
- **scales**: For color scales and other graphical settings.  
- **pbapply**: For parallelized operations during the bootstrap process.

### **Installation**
Before using `ConnectR`, you need to install these packages if they are not already installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```R
install.packages(c("readxl", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "scales", "pbapply"))
```
## **Output Example**

The `ConnectR` function returns a data frame with the calculated indices for each sheet in the input data. Here's an example of how the output might look:

### **Sample Output**

```R
  BC        AO        AE        NC      Sheet
1  0.25     0.75      0.50     0.30     Sheet1
2  0.35     0.70      0.45     0.32     Sheet2
3  0.40     0.65      0.60     0.28     Sheet3
```
### **Columns Explained**

- **BC:** Biogeographical Connectivity Index
  
- **AO:** Average Occurrences

- **AE:** Average Endemics

- **NC:** Network Clustering Index

- **Sheet:** Name of the sheet from which the data is derived.

In addition to the table of results, the function generates visualizations (histograms or density plots) showing the distribution of the bootstrapped values for each index.

Each bootstrapped index will have its own plot, making it easy to visualize the variability and stability of the indices over multiple iterations. The visualizations will be arranged dynamically based on the number of indices selected.
